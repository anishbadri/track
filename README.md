Track is collection of stuff from people. You can follow all the people you admire to see their favorite stuff to read listen and watch. 


The main goal of the project is to get familiar in Python as I build the system. So learning will be given importance over functionality. 


I will start with building a system with only CMD. When I think I am comforatable with the Basics of Python I will move towards connecting the DB, UI, Django etc. All that is not clear yet. So as I figure out step by step. I will also record the every day things I get done. The goal is to work on this for 30 days and maximize the learning.
